### This application is a weather, I did it as I completed "The Great Frontend Marathon" course.

I have almost finished with the functionality of this application, it remains to complete the _forecast_.
There were many goals, cases, and it turned out that I postponed the forecast for later.

#### This application implements the saving of favorite cities in local storage through the class - storage

In the **next weather application**, I will redo everything and make all the missing features.
